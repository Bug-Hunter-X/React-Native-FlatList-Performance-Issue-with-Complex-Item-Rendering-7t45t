This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with complex item rendering and large datasets. The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, resulting in slow scrolling and dropped frames.  The solution, `FlatListBugSolution.js`, addresses the issue by using techniques like `ItemSeparatorComponent`, `keyExtractor`, `useMemo`, and potentially `React.memo` to optimize rendering performance.  The README provides details on the bug, its cause, and the implemented solutions.
