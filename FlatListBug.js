In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using `FlatList` with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  If the `renderItem` function performs expensive operations or includes many nested components, it can lead to performance issues and dropped frames, resulting in a janky UI. This is especially noticeable when scrolling quickly.  The root cause often lies in unnecessary re-renders of list items that are off-screen or haven't changed.
